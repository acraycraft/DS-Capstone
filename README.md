### DATA 
All original Airbnb apartment data for Boston, D.C. and San Francisco is in the airbnb listing csv files. The data post-cleaning is listed as cityname_clean.csv.

### CODE
The code for this project was completed in R, in two parts. First, the raw data was processed in the DataCLeaning file, then the six regressions (one for each city including neighborhood, and one without) were run in the DataAnalysis file.
